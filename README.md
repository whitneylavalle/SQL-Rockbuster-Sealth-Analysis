# SQL-Rockbuster-Stealth-Analysis
This repository contains a SQL-based analysis of a (fictional) movie rental company, Rockbuster Stealth. It contains SQL queries based off several company dataframes to inform recommendations and strategy for the company. 
Rockbuster stealth used to have stores around the world, but is facing stiff competition from streaming services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime. The Rockbuster Stealth management team is planning to use its existing movie licenses to launch an online video rental service in order to stay competitive. 

I was tasked with acting as the data analyst for the BI department to help with the launch strategy for the new online video service.

First I loaded all of Rockbuster's data into a relational databse management system (RDBMS) before using SQL to analzye the data and answer key business questions.

Key questions included:
1. Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
2. What was the average rental duration for all videos?
3. Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
4. Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
5. Do sales figures vary between geographic regions?

I used sQL queries and Tableau to answer these questions in the form of a final presentation. Accompanying visualizations incldued below, sQL queries and final presentation included in his repository as separate files.
